# Fakebook

My name is Sandy, and with friends from Le Wagon (batch #1186), we decided to recreate an older and simpler version of Facebook (2005) with a modern design style.

IMPORTANT!
This is simply a project between passionate Le Wagon alumni developers. We are not trying to compete with the notorious Meta tool Facebook, but rather learn from the incredible advancements they made when it comes to the digital world of social media.
